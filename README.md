## Foundry/Forge Tips
Check out the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for more specifics.

### Updating Dependencies
```forge update``` will update all dependencies at once.

### Testing
```forge test``` will run all tests.
```forge test -m nameOfTest``` will run a specific test.

## Linting/Formatting
Run ```npm run solhint``` for linting to see Solidity warnings and errors.
Use ```npm run prettier:ts``` and ```npm run prettier:solidity``` to manually format TypeScript and Solidity.
These commands are automatically run pre-push via [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) Git hooks.

## Cheq subgraph (local)

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

To boostrap the local graph node, run:
